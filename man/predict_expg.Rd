\arguments{
\item{model_fit}{A goalmodel object.}

\item{team1}{A character vector with team names, for which to make predictions of.}

\item{team2}{A character vector with team names, for which to make predictions of.}

\item{x1}{Additional covariates to be used for making predictions.}

\item{x2}{Additional covariates to be used for making predictions.}

\item{return_df}{Whether a data.frame should be returned.}

\item{maxgoal}{Numeric, the upper limit of how many goals to make predictions for. If not set, a resonable upper limit will be found based on the data used to fit the model.}

\item{lwrx}{Numeric. The lowest upper limit for the number of goals to compute probabilities for, if maxgoal is not given.}

\item{ou}{Numeric, defining the over/under. Default is 2.5.}
}
\description{
Make predictions using a fitted goalmodel.
}
\details{
These functions predict expected goals, the probabilities for individual scorelines,
1x2 results, both teams to score, and total over/under probabilities.
