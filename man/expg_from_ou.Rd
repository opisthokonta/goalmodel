\title{Estimate the expected goals from over/under probabilities.
From a probability of goals scored being below a given number (like 2.5), compute
the expected number of goals scored, assuming an underlying Poisson distribution.}
\usage{
expg_from_ou(probability, ou = 2.5, under = TRUE, upperlim = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{probability}{Vector of probabilities for number of goals scored being less (or greater) than ou.}

\item{ou}{The limit the probability refers to. Default is 2.5.}

\item{under}{Logical indicating whether the probabilities are for 'under' (TRUE, default) or 'over' (FALSE).}

\item{upperlim}{Numeric giving the upper limit for expected goals the estimating procedure will consider.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with expected number of goals.
}
